Note that even though I've written email_port as an integer and DEBUG as a boolean, when they are read into your project 
they are interpreted as strings, so they will still need to be converted! Conclusion: environment variables are always strings.

If you're worried about the security of the text file on your PC, then you could encrypt the file using something like AXCrypt.

# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.
